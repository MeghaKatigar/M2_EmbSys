## Description 
 A smartwatch requires not only a clock and connectivity, it also needs to be able to solve common human problems. They are more sophisticated and have many features which make it
 easier to carry everywhere. Smart Watches need charging every one or two days. These are designed to be used as fitness trackers. Through the smart watches person can receive a call or put a message which connected to mobile via bluetooth.

 ## Component required to design the Smart watch:
 - Controller
 - Push Buttons
 - Voltage regulator
   - Voltage regulator is to keep the voltage in a circuit relatively close to a desired value.
   - Voltage regulators are one of the most common electronic components, since a power supply frequently produces raw current that would otherwise damage one of the components in the circuit.
 - Memory Chip
   - e.g Embedded MultiMediaCard (eMMC)
 - Humidity Sensor 
   - Humidity sensors are used to measure and monitor the amount of water present in the surrounding air.
   - Provides the actual humidity condition within the air at any given point or in any given place.
 - Accelerometer 
   - Accelerometers that measure how movement changes over timeâ€“currently, that means tracking whether you're walking, running, cycling, or sleeping.
 - Bluetooth
 - LCD Display
   - LCD or Liquid Crystal Display is the most common type of display used in smartwatches.
 - Temperature Sensor
   - It helps measure your body or skin temperature to keep a constant check on your health.  

## Latest Smart Watchs in the market:
